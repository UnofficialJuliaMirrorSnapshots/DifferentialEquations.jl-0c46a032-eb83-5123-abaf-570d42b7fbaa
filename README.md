This is a suite for numerically solving differential equations in Julia. The
purpose of this package is to supply efficient Julia implementations of solvers
for various differential equations. Equations within the realm of this package
include:

- Discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov)
  simulations)
- Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Split and Partitioned ODEs (Symplectic integrators, IMEX Methods)
- Stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs)
- Random differential equations (RODEs or RDEs)
- Differential algebraic equations (DAEs)
- Delay differential equations (DDEs)
- Mixed discrete and continuous equations (Hybrid Equations, Jump Diffusions)
- (Stochastic) partial differential equations ((S)PDEs) (with both finite
  difference and finite element methods)

The well-optimized DifferentialEquations solvers benchmark as the some of the fastest
implementations, using classic algorithms and ones from recent research which
routinely outperform the "standard" C/Fortran methods, and include algorithms
optimized for high-precision and HPC applications. At the same time, it wraps
the classic C/Fortran methods, making it easy to switch over to them whenever
necessary. It integrates with the Julia package sphere, for example using Juno's
progress meter, automatic plotting, built-in interpolations, and wraps other
differential equation solvers so that many different methods for solving the
equations can be accessed by simply switching a keyword argument. It utilizes
Julia's generality to be able to solve problems specified with arbitrary number
types (types with units like Unitful, and arbitrary precision numbers like
BigFloats and ArbFloats), arbitrary sized arrays (ODEs on matrices), and more.
This gives a powerful mixture of speed and productivity features to help you
solve and analyze your differential equations faster.


For information on using the package,
[see the stable documentation](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/). Use the
[latest documentation](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/) for the version of
the documentation which contains the un-released features.

All of the algorithms are thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy via convergence
tests. The algorithms are continuously tested to show correctness.
